#  Klimate - Modern Weather Application

**Klimate** is a next-generation weather application designed to deliver accurate, real-time weather data in an intuitive, visually stunning, and accessible interface. Built with cutting-edge web technologies, it aims to simplify weather information while elevating user experience.

---

##  Project Overview

###  Vision
To empower users with reliable weather information that seamlessly integrates into their daily lives, enabling informed decisions with ease.

###  Core Objectives
- Provide **real-time weather updates** with a user-friendly interface.
- Offer **global accessibility** with smart features like location awareness and city search.
- Ensure **personalization**, **responsiveness**, and **seamless usability** across devices.

---

##  Technologies Used

### 1. **React & TypeScript (Frontend)**
- React provides a **component-based architecture** for building dynamic and interactive UIs.
- TypeScript ensures **type safety**, reducing bugs and making the development process more robust.

### 2. **Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui (Styling)**
- **Tailwind CSS** accelerates the design process with utility-first CSS classes.
- **shadcn/ui** offers pre-built, customizable UI components for consistent and accessible design.

### 3. **React Router (Routing)**
- Enables seamless navigation between pages, ensuring a smooth single-page application (SPA) experience.

### 4. **TanStack Query (React Query, State Management)**
- Manages server-side state efficiently, including:
  - Data fetching
  - Caching
  - Real-time synchronization with the UI

### 5. **Recharts (Data Visualization)**
- Used to create **interactive graphs** and visualizations for weather data (e.g., hourly temperature trends, 5-day forecasts).

### 6. **OpenWeatherMap API (Weather Data Source)**
- Provides reliable and real-time weather data, including:
  - Current conditions
  - 5-day forecasts
  - Geocoding for location searches

### 7. **Custom React Hooks**
- Encapsulate reusable logic for a cleaner and more modular codebase:
  - `use-geolocation`: Fetches the user's current location.
  - `use-favorite`: Manages favorite locations using local storage.
  - `use-weather`: Handles weather data fetching with React Query.

### 8. **Vite (Build Tool)**
- Offers a **fast development environment** with instant hot module replacement (HMR).
